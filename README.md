#Smooth-Anchors

###Easy smooth scrolling to HTML anchors.

With this pseudo-plugin (I'll be turning it into a real plugin over time) you can easily set up smooth scrolling from your anchor tag to your anchors on the page.

To modify the speed or offset (distance from top of window to scrolled element), simply modify the lines for "scrollSpeed" and "topOffset".
